# updating_flash_report
Script updates a summarized report of product earnings. One of the issues we had in the company was pulling data from so many different websites. This script consolidates grabbing earnings from each website into one script. The updates powers a "flash" report, which is a quick summary of product earnings in an excel file. It also powers a Power BI dashboard that goes into more detail revenue/earnings.

Script isn't error proof at all. That definitely needs to be added in the future.
